## Turn Structure

### Player 1's Turn:
1. **Draw** 1 card from Main Deck
2. **Check for Set** - Do you have Position + Intensity + Time?
   - **YES** → Play the set:
     - Add it to the **Queue** (public area)
     - Earn **1 point**
     - **Optional:** Spend 1 point to draw from Equipment Deck and attach to this punishment
   - **NO** → Discard 1 card from your hand
3. Your turn ends (keep 5 cards in hand)

### Player 2's Turn:
1. **Draw** 1 card from Main Deck
2. **Check for Set** - Do you have Position + Intensity + Time?
   - **YES** → Play the set:
     - Add it to the **Queue** (public area)
     - Draw **1 card** from Pleasure Deck (keep it - this is your reward!)
   - **NO** → Discard 1 card from your hand
3. Your turn ends (keep 5 cards in hand)

---

## Special Cards

### Steal Card
- Play this card on your turn (instead of discarding)
- Take **1 random card** from opponent's hand
- Add it to your hand

### Ask For Card
- Play this card on your turn (instead of discarding)
- Ask opponent for a **specific card type** (Position, Intensity, Time, or Special)
- If they have it, they **must give** you one card of that type
- If they don't have it, nothing happens

---

## The Queue (Public Area)

- All completed sets go here
- Both players can see what punishments are queued
- Equipment cards are attached to specific punishments in the queue

**Example Queue:**
```
1. Over Knee + Medium + 5min [+ Small Plug]
2. Bent Over Table + Hard + 10min [+ Nipple Clamps + Vibrator]
3. Against Wall + Light + 2min
```

- **Queue is public:** Both players can see all punishments waiting
- **Equipment attaches to punishments:** Not standalone
- **Player 2's pleasure cards:** Don't go in queue - Player 2 keeps them
- **Points carry over:** Player 1's unspent points remain between turns
- **Special cards:** Can be played instead of discarding (don't need a full set)

---

## Strategy Tips

### For Player 1:
- Save points to stack equipment on one punishment
- Watch Player 2's hand size - if they're collecting cards, they might have a set soon
- Equipment makes punishments more intense
- You need 5 punishments in queue to win

### For Player 2:
- Collect 5 pleasures to win
- Use "Skip Punishment" strategically on heavily-equipped punishments
- "Remove Equipment" can defang Player 1's most intense setups
- "Stop Game" ends it all immediately if needed
